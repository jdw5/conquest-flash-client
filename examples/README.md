# Examples
Provided are sample code for suggested implementation of the toast component. It is suggested you create a `ToastRegion` and `BannerRegion` component as done here, and insert this into a shared root layout for your Vue application. 

You can then modify the implementation of the `Toast` or `Banner` component to your needs.

Ensure you have the `plugin` installed in your `app.js` file to intercept Inertia messages and display them as a banner or toast.
